History
--------

In 1999 the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved the creation of an international project with the purpose of integrate and modernize the various composing parts of the legislative sphere. Brazil was chosen as the pilot for the project and in order to execute the project an special secretary was created in the Brazilian Federal Senate. This program was called Interlegis.

Colab is a framework designed to help developers to build web systems composed by multiple web applications.

Computer systems, both software and hardware, are increasingly being integrated into bigger and more complex systems. This is also true when it comes to the Web. A great number of web applications already provide interfaces to allow other systems, either web or not to communicate with than. Along with integration comes the question: How to ensure that such complex systems are maintainable?

The integration of independently designed and developed systems, in many cases, require modifications in each of the integrated parts. That occurs because the parts were not designed for integration but actually to serve specific purposes. In some cases where the source code is available the changes can be made by a team of developers (integrators) but in other cases the requirements need to be addressed to the company or people developing and maintaining it. None of the two scenarios are ideal because in both cases the modifications would impact system maintainability.

Aiming to mitigate those problems Colab provides tools that allows developers to integrate web applications without having to modify their source code. That allows applications to be easily updated or even replaced.
